# silly-pages

This repo contains a copy of static pages from [my 2019 Advent Calendar project](https://github.com/SarahFrench/AdventCalendar). After Heroku's free tier was killed off the hosted version of that project was removed from the web. A majority of the project was static pages, so this repo contains a copy of the HTML, CSS and JS from those pages.

## Edits to the pages

All pages require a bit of editing, to remove use of Rails etc. However some pages needed more editing because they previously saved data to a backend database. Below are some details about those changes.

### fart-game

Previously users could compete to be in a top-5 leaderboard for the game. Without a backend in GitHub Pages that feature is no longer possible.

### draw

Previously I allowed users to save their drawing to a gallery, but this isn't possible without a backend in GitHub Pages.

### troll

I fixed up the CSS because it was a hot mess. Now it's just a mess.
